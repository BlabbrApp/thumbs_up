vote_fu
==============

Allows an arbitrary number of entites (including Users) to vote on models. Adapted from act_as_voteable. Differences from acts_as_voteable include: 

1. You can specify the model name that initiates votes. 
2. You can, with a little tuning, have more than one entity type vote on more than one model type. 
3. Adds "acts_as_voter" behavior to the initiator of votes.

== Resources

Install
 * Run the following command:
	./script/plugin install git://github.com/peteonrails/vote_fu.git 
	
 * Create a new rails migration using the generator:
	./script/generate voteable
	
 
== Usage
 
 * Make your ActiveRecord model act as voteable.
 
 class Model < ActiveRecord::Base
 	acts_as_voteable
 end

 * Make your ActiveRecord model(s) that vote act as voter.

 class User < ActiveRecord::Base
 	acts_as_voter
 end

 class Robot < ActiveRecord::Base
 	acts_as_voter
 end
